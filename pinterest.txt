PINTEREST CODING INTERVIEW

PHASES:
phone screen
technical screen ~ 1 hour --> some behavioral elements but mostly coding
full day final round ~ 4+ hours --> primarily coding interviews, and possibly 
system design

STEPS
focus --> what role are you interviewing for? (typically general full stack)
be cognizant of hiring cycles for interns/new grads
compile resources that focus on getting you prepared for coding interviews
10-15 hours a week for 1-2 months to prepare for technical interviews
select problems with a difficulty that mirrors real interviews (medium, hard)
attempt problems for at least 30 minutes

FUNDAMENTALS TO STUDY
- merge, quick, breadth-first, depth-first, and binary search
- arrays, lists, linked lists, hash tables, trees, graphs, stacks and queues, heaps
- big o, recursion

PROBLEM APPROACHES
pattern matching, simplify and generalize, base case and build, data structure 
brain dump

Things to ask yourself: what data structures can I use to make this easier?
