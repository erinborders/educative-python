the Internet is a network of networks. Each network is made up of 
devices, called end systems, connected to each other with communication 
links. These devices are often also called edge systems in networking 
jargon because they are technically situated at the ‘edge’ of the 
Internet since they don’t relay data from one device to another.

Access networks, also known as the last mile, consist of the media 
through which end systems connect to the Internet. In other words, 
access networks are networks that physically connect end systems to 
the first router on a path which connects them to some other end 
systems.

Some networks have varying upload and download transmission rates, 
called asymmetric transmission rates. This is useful because traffic 
going out from end hosts generally consists of small requests which 
solicit comparatively much larger responses.

A Digital Subscriber Line or DSL uses the existing groundwork of 
telephone lines for an Internet connection.


Computers or end systems are generally connected together to share resources 
and information such as an Internet connection and devices such as printers. 
These networks can be classified by the geographical distance that they span:
- Local Area Networks (LAN)/Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN)
- Metropolitan Area Networks (MAN)
- Wide Area Networks (WAN - typically optical fiber-based)

Synchronous optical networking (SONET) and the international equivalent, Synchronous 
Digital Hierarchy (SDH) carries data as optical signals over optical fiber, which 
means that they can cover large distances.

NETWORK TOPOLOGIES
(how the data flows in the network)

- Bus: Every end system will receive any signal that is sent on the main or backbone 
medium. But a break in the cable will disable the whole thing and only one system
can transmit at a time

- Ring: end systems communicate with each other through each other. So the message 
travels along the ring passing each system until the target system itself is reached.
But data flow is unidirectional and a break in the cable would still disrupt the system.

- Star: All end systems talk to each other through one central device such as a router 
or switch. All hosts can transmit at the same time but if the router fails then the 
network is completely down.

- Tree: This topology is also known as the star-bus topology. It essentially consists 
of a bunch of star networks connected together with a large bus.

- Mesh: every end system is directly connected to every other end system. But it's 
expensive, hard to scale and used in specialized applications only.
