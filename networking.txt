the Internet is a network of networks. Each network is made up of 
devices, called end systems, connected to each other with communication 
links. These devices are often also called edge systems in networking 
jargon because they are technically situated at the ‘edge’ of the 
Internet since they don’t relay data from one device to another.

Access networks, also known as the last mile, consist of the media 
through which end systems connect to the Internet. In other words, 
access networks are networks that physically connect end systems to 
the first router on a path which connects them to some other end 
systems.

Some networks have varying upload and download transmission rates, 
called asymmetric transmission rates. This is useful because traffic 
going out from end hosts generally consists of small requests which 
solicit comparatively much larger responses.

A Digital Subscriber Line or DSL uses the existing groundwork of 
telephone lines for an Internet connection.
