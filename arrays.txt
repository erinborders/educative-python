ARRAYS

In Python, an array is just an ordered sequence of homogeneous elements. In other words, 
an array can only hold elements of one datatype. Python arrays are basically just wrappers 
for C arrays.

To initialize an array:
import array
new_array = array.array('type', [list])

EXAMPLE:
new_array = array.array('d', [1, 2, 3])
print(new_array[0])

TYPES OF ARRAYS:

c - character
b/B, h/H, i, l - integer
u - unicode character
I/L - long
f, d - float

ADDING ELEMENTS TO AN ARRAY:

import array
integers = array.array('i', [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10])

# changing first element
integers[0] = 0
print(integers)  # array('i', [0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10])

# changing 3rd to 5th element
integers[2:5] = array.array('i', [4, 6, 8])
print(integers)     # Output: array('i', [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10])

Just as with lists, we can add one item to the end of an array using 
the append() method or add several items using the extend() method.

To delete one or more items from an array, use the del statement as 
with lists. We can use the remove(val) method to remove the given item 
or pop(index) to remove an item at the given index. The remove(val) 
method removes the first element that is equal to val in the array.
